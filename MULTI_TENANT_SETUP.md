# üåæ Multi-Tenant Agricultural Shop - Complete Setup Guide

## üéØ Overview

Your agricultural shop website has been successfully transformed from a **single-tenant** to a **multi-tenant** architecture! This means:

- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Data**: All shop information is now fetched from the database
- ‚úÖ **Shop-Specific**: Each deployment serves data for one specific shop
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Easy to deploy for multiple shops with different SHOP_ID
- ‚úÖ **No Static Data**: Removed hardcoded contact information
- ‚úÖ **Context-Based**: Uses React Context for state management

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. **Environment Setup**

```bash
# Run the complete setup wizard
node scripts/complete-setup.js
```

This interactive script will:

- Set up your MongoDB password
- Test database connection
- Create a shop with sample data
- Guide you through the configuration

### 2. **Alternative: Manual Setup**

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# 1. Set up MongoDB password
node scripts/setup-mongodb.js

# 2. Create a shop (choose option 1 for quick setup)
node scripts/quick-shop-creator.js

# 3. Verify everything is working
node scripts/verify-setup.js
```

### 3. **Start Your Application**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your shop!

## üìã Required Environment Variables

Your `.env` file should contain:

```env
# MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname

# Shop Configuration (get this from shop creation script)
SHOP_ID=your_shop_id_here

# Authentication (if you haven't set these yet)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## üè™ Shop Management

### Creating a Shop

**Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)**

```bash
node scripts/complete-setup.js
```

**Option 2: Quick Creation with Template**

```bash
node scripts/quick-shop-creator.js 1
```

**Option 3: View Available Templates**

```bash
node scripts/quick-shop-creator.js
```

### Admin Panel Access

After creating a shop:

1. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
2. Login with:
   - **Email**: The email you provided during shop creation
   - **Password**: `admin123` (change this immediately!)

## üîß Architecture Overview

### Before (Single-Tenant)

```
Components ‚Üí Static Data (lib/data.ts) ‚Üí Hardcoded Information
```

### After (Multi-Tenant)

```
Components ‚Üí Shop Context ‚Üí API ‚Üí MongoDB ‚Üí Dynamic Shop Data
```

### Key Components Transformed

1. **Shop Context Provider** (`contexts/shop-context.tsx`)

   - Fetches shop data from `/api/shop`
   - Provides `useContactInfo()` hook
   - Handles loading and error states

2. **API Endpoint** (`app/api/shop/route.ts`)

   - Fetches shop data based on `SHOP_ID` environment variable
   - Returns shop-specific information

3. **Updated Components**:
   - `components/public-header.tsx` - Dynamic shop name
   - `components/public-footer.tsx` - Dynamic contact info
   - `components/admin-header.tsx` - Dynamic shop name
   - `app/page.tsx` - Dynamic contact buttons
   - `app/contact/page.tsx` - Dynamic contact information
   - `app/about/page.tsx` - Dynamic shop story
   - `app/products/[id]/page.tsx` - Dynamic contact functions

## üîç Verification

### Automated Verification

```bash
node scripts/verify-setup.js
```

This script checks:

- ‚úÖ Environment configuration
- ‚úÖ Database connection
- ‚úÖ Shop data existence
- ‚úÖ API file structure
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant setup completion

### Manual Verification

1. **Shop Data Loading**: Visit your website and check if shop name appears correctly
2. **Contact Information**: Verify phone/WhatsApp buttons work with your shop's numbers
3. **Admin Panel**: Login and verify shop information is correct
4. **No Static Data**: Ensure no hardcoded contact information is displayed

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### "Shop not found" Error

```bash
# Check if your SHOP_ID is correct
node scripts/verify-setup.js

# Or create a new shop
node scripts/quick-shop-creator.js 1
```

### "Contact information not available"

- Ensure your shop has complete contact information
- Check that SHOP_ID matches a shop in your database
- Verify the shop context is loading correctly

### MongoDB Connection Issues

```bash
# Fix password and connection issues
node scripts/setup-mongodb.js
```

### Static Data Still Showing

```bash
# Verify all static imports have been removed
node scripts/verify-setup.js
```

## üìä Database Schema

### Shop Collection

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  shopName: "Shop Name in Hindi/Local",
  shopNameEnglish: "Shop Name in English",
  ownerName: "Owner Name in Hindi/Local",
  ownerNameEnglish: "Owner Name in English",
  phone: "+91-XXXXXXXXXX",
  whatsapp: "+91-XXXXXXXXXX",

}
```

## üöÄ Deployment for Multiple Shops

To deploy this application for different shops:

1. **Create a Shop**: Use the creation scripts to add shop data to database
2. **Set SHOP_ID**: Update the environment variable for each deployment
3. **Deploy**: Each deployment will automatically serve that shop's data

Example deployment environments:

```bash
# Shop 1 Deployment
SHOP_ID=shop_1_id_here

# Shop 2 Deployment
SHOP_ID=shop_2_id_here
```
